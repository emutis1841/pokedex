**POKEDEX**

I took the idea from James Q Quick channel on youtube `https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-VQUKeSU1w`

Description: it's a pokedex with vanilla js and no preprocessors for css or html.

It just fetch the information from pokedex api `https://pokeapi.co/` and create a template for every pokemon

Features:

- You can search a pokemon by name clicking on the magnifying glass
- To display all the information of the pokemon just click on the card and a modal will be displayed

If you have any suggestion or improve please feel free to collaborate.

Enjoy it :nerd_face:
